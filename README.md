# Analyzing-NYC-High-School-Data
For a brief bit of background, the SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is a test that high school seniors in the U.S. take every year. The SAT has three sections, each of which is worth a maximum of 800 points. Colleges use the SAT to determine which students to admit.
High average SAT scores are usually indicative of a good school.
In this Project, we explored relationships between SAT scores and demographic factors in New York City public schools.
