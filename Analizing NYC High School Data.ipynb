    "One of the most controversial issues in the U.S. educational system is the efficacy of standardized tests, and whether they're unfair to certain groups. Given our prior knowledge of this topic, investigating the correlations between SAT scores and demographics might be an interesting angle to take. We could correlate SAT scores with factors like race, gender, income, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is an exam that U.S. high school students take before applying to college. Colleges take the test scores into account when deciding who to admit, so it's fairly important to perform well on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test consists of three sections, each of which has 800 possible points. The combined score is out of 2,400 possible points (while this number has changed a few times, the data set for our project is based on 2,400 total points). Organizations often rank high schools by their average SAT scores. The scores are also considered a measure of overall school district quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "New York City makes its data on [high school SAT scores](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4) available online, as well as the [demographics for each high school](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2014-2015-DOE-High-School-Directory/n3p6-zve2)"

    "Unsurprisingly, SAT Critical Reading Avg. Score, SAT Math Avg. Score, SAT Writing Avg. Score, and sat_score are strongly correlated with sat_score.\n",

    "\n",
    "- total_enrollment has a strong positive correlation with sat_score. This is surprising because we'd expect smaller schools where students receive more attention to have higher scores. However, it looks like the opposite is true -- larger schools tend to do better on the SAT.\n",
    "- Other columns that are proxies for enrollment correlate similarly. These include total_students, N_s, N_p, N_t, AP Test Takers, Total Exams Taken, and NUMBER OF SECTIONS.\n",
    "- Both the percentage of females (female_per) and number of females (female_num) at a school correlate positively with SAT score, whereas the percentage of males (male_per) and the number of males (male_num) correlate negatively. This could indicate that women do better on the SAT than men.\n",
    "- Teacher and student ratings of school safety (saf_t_11, and saf_s_11) correlate with sat_score.\n",
    "- Student ratings of school academic standards (aca_s_11) correlate with sat_score, but this does not hold for ratings from teachers and parents (aca_p_11 and aca_t_11).\n",
    "- There is significant racial inequality in SAT scores (white_per, asian_per, black_per, hispanic_per).\n",
    "- The percentage of English language learners at the school (ell_percent, frl_percent) has a strong negative correlation with SAT scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because enrollment seems to have such a strong correlation, let's make a scatterplot of total_enrollment vs sat_score. Each point in the scatterplot will represent a high school, so we'll be able to see if there are any interesting patterns."

    "\n",
    "This analysis investigated factors that relate to average SAT performance at individual schools. The presence of these relationship should not be taken to imply a causal link. These relationships could exist because of coincidence, or because they stem from the same underlying cause, or because one is the cause of the other. This analysis can't distinguish among those possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "We found:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There isn't clear evidence of gender bias in the SAT.\n",
    "- There is evidence that race and associated factors do relate to SAT scores. However, this relationship also seems to involve the relationship between race and low socioeconomic status.\n",
    "- SAT scores of hispanic students are also likely influenced by a high percentage immigrant English language learners, many of whom didn't receive adequate schooling in their home countries. This intersects with the fact that the SAT is only given in English.\n"
